		   <h4>A chemical element is a species of atoms that have a given number of protons in their nuclei, including
		   the pure substance consisting only of that species.[1] Unlike chemical compounds, chemical elements cannot be broken
		   down into simpler substances by any chemical reaction. The number of protons in the nucleus is the defining property of
		   an element, and is referred to as its atomic number (represented by the symbol Z) – all atoms with the same atomic number
		   are atoms of the same element.[1] Almost all of the baryonic matter of the universe is composed of chemical elements 
		   (among rare exceptions are neutron stars). When different elements undergo chemical reactions, atoms are rearranged 
		   into new compounds held together by chemical bonds. Only a minority of elements, such as silver and gold, are found
		   uncombined as relatively pure native element minerals. Nearly all other naturally occurring elements occur in the
		   Earth as compounds or mixtures. Air is primarily a mixture of the elements nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, though it does 
		   contain compounds including carbon dioxide and water.
                            
            The history of 
            the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that discovered native 
            minerals like carbon, sulfur, copper and gold (though the concept of a chemical element was not yet understood). 
            Attempts to classify materials such as these resulted in the concepts of classical elements, alchemy, and various 
            similar theories throughout human history. Much of the modern understanding of elements developed from the work of
            Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist who published the first recognizable periodic table in 1869. This table 
            organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows ("periods") in which the columns ("groups")
            share recurring ("periodic") physical and chemical properties. The periodic table summarizes various properties
            of the elements, allowing chemists to derive relationships between them and to make predictions about compounds
            and potential new ones...</h4> <br>
